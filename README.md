# Semi-MsTGANet
# Multi-scale transformer global attention network (MsTGANet) and its semi-supervised version Semi-MsTGANet for drusen segmentation in retinal OCT images will be released when the paper is published.
# For the purpose of academic research, we invited the ophthalmologist to guide the pixel-level annotations of 972 OCT images from the public UCSD dataset. Therefore, the data is only used for academic research. If researches want to obtain the pixel-level annotation for academic research purposes, they can send an email request to wangmeng9218@126.com or other members of our team after this paper is published, and we will share the data with the requestor after the application is approved.
